For any external source file images/javascript/css 
NEED TO change the file path as the following for django
<img src = "{% static 'img.jpg' %}">
<img src = "{% static 'css.css' %}">
<img src = "{% static 'javascript.js' %}">

And at the first line of any template (html file)
ADD 
{% load static %}

If you're running Django 3 and were on an older version before, you need to replace:
{% load static from staticfiles %} or {% load staticfiles %} with just: {% load static %}
